### About this project  

The goals of this project were to:  

A) demonstrate how to retrieve and use book data from [Open Library](https://archive.org/details/ol_data?tab=about), an Internet Archive project that aims to catalog every book ever published and make the data freely available.  
 
B) examine potential lasting effects of a public library reading challenge on one reader (a case study)

### About the data  

The dataset was a .csv file containing the titles, authors, and dates borrowed of 607 library books, sorted into quarterly (3-month) periods from January 1, 2020 to mid-June, 2024. Python code was used to retrieve information on the subjects of these books from the Open Library repository.  

### How to use Open Library's Python tools to retrieve book information      

1. Install Python; a Miniconda installation is sufficient.

2. Install or update 'pip', a Python package manager.

3. Install the OpenLibrary Python package, a library of tools created and maintained by Open Library for accessing their data.
